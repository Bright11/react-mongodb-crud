In creating mongodb for your backend application, you have to first initialized your project, to do so
1) type npm init -y

After this, we need to install some of the depencies we will need, below is the list os them
express, body-parser, cors, mongoose, and nodemon

npm install express body-parser cors mongoose nodemon
or npm i express body-parser cors mongoose nodemon

After the installetion, create a file on the same root directary and name it index.js inside this file, imoport all the depencies you just installed

inside pakage.json, include this,"type": "module", after "main", now add this

 "scripts": {
   "start": "nodemon index.js" // this code helps you to start the server without always restarting it when you make changes
  },

for code example check mongondb connection code.txt
